Frontend control station mockup for a robot food delivery service.  

The UI allows an employee to visually monitor the robot's geographical location and its respective states.
Clicking the marker will show the robots diagnostics and the order info.

Each robot's states are displayed in the display panel on the right hand side, allowing for a quick overview.

At the bottom, the robot's state is controlled by a drop down menu.  Upon choosing a robot from the drop down menu, the State dropdown
menu will load the selected robot's current state.  If the user updates the robot's state, the display panel will reflect this
change.
